The dataset consists of features extracted from mammogram images.

## Algorithms Used

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **Decision Tree Classifier**
- **Logistic Regression**

## Dataset

The dataset includes:
- Features extracted from mammogram images.
- Labels indicating tumor type (malignant or benign).
